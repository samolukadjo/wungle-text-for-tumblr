        Hide text in plain sight, and find the text hidden by others via browser
        extension.
      </p>
      <p>Basically, the point is to replicate the fictional extension in <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/lukadjo/760531708515909632/someone-should-make-this-real-just-figure-out-a">this post.</a></p>

      <p>Available on Firefox and Firefox for Android!</p>

        </a>
      </div>

      <p>Due to chrome extension development monetary requirements (publishing a chrome extension costs real money), this extension is only available on the Firefox Add-on store. <!-- To install it on chrome, downaload the <a href="https://github.com/samolukadjo/wungle-text-for-tumblr/realeases/latest">file</a> and install it manually.--></p>
      <p>Making the post actually flip over will have to wait until all the all important functionality (creating and reading) works as well as it can.</p>

        <h2>The Specification</h2>
        <p>(If you're just using the extension you don't have to care about or read this.)</p>
        <p>The wungle text specification as devised by Lukadjo is as follows:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Wungle text is encoded using the 3y3 encoding.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              It must be added to the start of a paragraph in a tumblr post.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              It must, unencoded, end with '{wungle text ends here}' (without the quotes) so that the point where it ends and the visible content begins is easily detectable.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As long as you encode the wungle text according to the outlined rules, it will work with the extension.</p>
