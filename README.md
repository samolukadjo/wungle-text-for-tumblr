# Wungle Text For Tumblr

This will hopefully one day be an extension that replicates [this](https://www.tumblr.com/lukadjo/760531708515909632/someone-should-make-this-real-just-figure-out-a).

## Installation

This extension is available on the [Firefox Add-on Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wungle-text-for-tumblr/) for both desktop and android firefox.

## Implementation

A proof of concept finally exists, using 3y3 it allows you to encode text that when added to the start of a paragraph in a tumblr post allows it to be read as wungle text.

Making the posts flip over, etc., will also happen at some point.

## Contribution

If you have any problems or suggestions please create an issue and if you have any improvements to the code fork this repo and make a pull request to **the dev branch**.
