# Wungle Text For Tumblr

This will hopefully one day be an extension that replicates [this](https://www.tumblr.com/lukadjo/760531708515909632/someone-should-make-this-real-just-figure-out-a).

Currently its a big ol' pile of nothin'. But I hope to make it something.

## Implementation

Currently the idea is to use 3y3.js to embed the wungle text into the post itself thus eliminating the need for a database or other online service.

## Contribution

If you have aby problems or suggestions please create an issue and if you have any improvements to the code fork this repo and make a pull request once coded.
