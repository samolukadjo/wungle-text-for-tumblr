# Wungle Text For Tumblr

This will hopefully one day be an extension that replicates [this](https://www.tumblr.com/lukadjo/760531708515909632/someone-should-make-this-real-just-figure-out-a).

Its still in the earliest of stages.

## Installation

This extension is still in development so no realeses exist yet. If you want to try it, clone the repo and load temporary addon/plugin in your browser.

## Implementation

A proof of concept finally exists, using 3y3 it allows you to encode text that when added to the start of a paragraph in a tumblr post allows it to be read as wungle text.

## Contribution

If you have aby problems or suggestions please create an issue and if you have any improvements to the code fork this repo and make a pull request.
